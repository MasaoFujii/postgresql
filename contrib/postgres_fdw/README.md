# postgres_fdw_plus

## Configuration Parameters

### postgres_fdw.two_phase_commit (enum)
If true, only foreign transactions writing data on remote servers are
committed by using two phase commit protocol (2PC). 2PC is not used
for read-only foreign transactions. If always, all foreign transactions
including even read-only ones are committed via 2PC.
If false (default), all foreign transactions are committed as
postgres_fdw currently does, i.e., 2PC is not used at all.

Any users can change this setting.

### postgres_fdw.skip_commit_phase (boolean)
If true, foreign transactions to be processed via two phase commit
protocol are marked just as prepared, but not actually committed,
i.e., prepare phase is performed but commit phase not. This setting
is useful to create foreign prepared transactions purposely for
the test or debug, for example. Those foreign prepared transactions
are expected to be committed or rollbacked by the functions to
resolve them. If false (default), both phases are performed in 2PC.
This setting has no effect if postgres_fdw.two_phase_commit is false.

Any users can change this setting.

### postgres_fdw.track_xact_commits (boolean)
If true (default), information about transactions that used two phase
commit protocol and was successfully committed are collected in
pgfdw_plus.xact_commits table. If false, no such information is collected.
This setting has no effect if postgres_fdw.two_phase_commit is false.

Any users can change this setting.

## Functions

### SETOF resolve_foreign_prepared_xacts pgfdw_plus_resolve_foreign_prepared_xacts (server name, force boolean)
Resolve (commit or rollback) foreign transactions prepared but not
committed yet on the specified remote servers. This function issues
COMMIT PREPARED for a foreign transaction if the local transaction
that started it was committed, and ROLLBACK PREPARED otherwise.

Note that it may be impossible to determine whether a local transaction
is committed or rollbacked when its full transaction ID is not found
in pgfdw_plus.xact_commits. There can be two cases where a local
transaction was committed but its ID was not recorded because
postgres_fdw.track_xact_commits was disabled, and it was rollbacked
so its ID was not recorded. If force is false (default), this function
does nothing for foreign prepared transactions of such "uncertain"
local transaction. Those foreign transactions need to be resolved by hand.
If force is true, this function determines that the local transaction
was aborted and rollbacks those foreign prepared transactions. If it's
guaranteed that all local transactions are tracked in
pgfdw_plus.xact_commits, e.g., because postgres_fdw.track_xact_commits
was never disabled, force can be safely set to true.

This function is restricted to superusers by default,
but other users can be granted EXECUTE to run the function.

Only users having valid user mapping to the specified server is allowed
to execute this function.

This function returns one row per foreign prepared transaction that
it successfully resolved, shown in the table below.

| Column Name   | Data Type | Description                                    |
|---------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------|
| status          | text      | transaction status (committed or aborted) of this foreign prepared transaction |
| server        | name      | name of server that this foreign prepared transaction existed |
| transaction         | xid   | transaction ID of this foreign prepared transaction |
| gid   | text    | global transaction ID that was assigned to this foreign prepared transaction |
| prepared | timestamptz    | time at which this foreign transaction was prepared for commit |
| owner    | name    | name of the user that executed this foreign transaction |
| database   | name    | name of the database in which this foreign transaction was executed |

### SETOF resolve_foreign_prepared_xacts pgfdw_plus_resolve_foreign_prepared_xacts_all (force boolean)
Execute pgfdw_plus_resolve_foreign_prepared_xacts() for all defined servers,
i.e., it resolves (commits or rollbacks) foreign transactions prepared
but not committed yet on those servers. This function ignores a server
whose foreign data wrapper is not postgres_fdw.

This function is restricted to superusers by default,
but other users can be granted EXECUTE to run the function.

Whenever this function executes pgfdw_plus_resolve_foreign_prepared_xacts()
for each server, it finds the proper user having a valid user mapping to
the server and changes the current user to the user by using SET ROLE.
So the caller of this function must be a superuser or a user having
memberships of all those "proper" users.

Please see the descriptions of pgfdw_plus_resolve_foreign_prepared_xacts() for
the details about the argument "force" and the return values.

### SETOF pgfdw_plus.xact_commits pgfdw_plus_vacuum_xact_commits()
Delete any records no longer necessary to resolve foreign prepared
transactions, from pgfdw_plus.xact_commits. This function returns
records that it deleted from pgfdw_plus.xact_commits.

This function is restricted to superusers by default,
but other users can be granted EXECUTE to run the function.

The caller of this function must be a superuser or a user having
memberships of all users having valid user mappings to all defined servers.
